MOTI is a cross-platform web app developed by Pioneer Street.

It is written in TypeScript using Ionic-React framework.



## Installation

First, make sure your computer has [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git) installed.

Then, clone the repository by running the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/fzmi/moti.git
cd moti
```

Next, install the Ionic CLI and project dependencies:
