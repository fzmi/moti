# MOTI

MOTI is a cross-platform web app written in TypeScript using Ionic-React framework, developed by Pioneer Street.

## Installation

First, make sure your computer has [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git) installed.

Then, clone the repository by running the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/fzmi/moti.git
cd moti
```

Next, install the Ionic CLI and project dependencies:

```
npm install -g @ionic/cli
npm install
```

If the first command encountered permission issues, run `sudo npm install -g @ionic/cli` instead and then enter your computer password when prompted.

Finally, host the project locally by running:

```
ionic serve
```

Open `http://localhost:8100` in your browser.
